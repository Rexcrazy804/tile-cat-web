# About
This is a project that I am working on rather irregularly, this will be updated whenver enough features are added. Please note that the game will take a while to load depending on your bandwidth during which the page will be blank.
This game is written in Rust using the [Bevy Engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)
