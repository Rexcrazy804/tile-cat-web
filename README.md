# About
This is a project that I am working on rather irregularly, this will be updated
whenver enough features are added. Please note that the game will take a while
to load depending on your bandwidth during which the page will be blank. This
game is written in Rust using the [Bevy Engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)

> The source code is now PUBLIC at [Rexcrazy804/tile_cat](https://github.com/Rexcrazy804/tile_cat)

# UPDATE: v0.4.0
- You can reconfigure your controlls
- Proper game loop
- featuring scores and hearts
- Bugs now move faster as your score increases
- if a bug reaches the right of the screen you lose a heart
- on losing all 5 hearts game is over
